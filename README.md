# AppEx-Releases

This repo contains all of the zipped AppEx releases, each zip file contains two further zip files, the applet and the DXD.

Currently we support Meta-Forms, for which the "edit-forms v#.zip" file is the applet while the "Cinchy Meta Forms v#.zip" file is the DXD. For more information on installation, setup and configuration of Meta-Forms as well as an overview of it, please visit: https://cinchy.gitbook.io/cinchy-meta-forms/
